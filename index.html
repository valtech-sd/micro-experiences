          <p>sound recognition by valtech has the ability to decode different channels of sound</p>
          <p>
            here is an example of different pitch levels of sound being captured by a microphone
          </p>
          <p>using this data, we are able to control the effects of our valtech logo</p>

          <p>
            camera tracking is a process valtech uses which involves taking a post that has been
            filmed in real time by a camera and tracking it's motion so that 3d elements can be
            added and/or manipulated to it
          </p>
          <p>
            we can track the skeletal body and control data points by recognizing movements through
            the camera's input sensors
